      This page provides a sample nap schedule but unlike mostâ€”if not allâ€”baby
      schedule generators, the time and length of naps or awake times can be
      adjusted.

    <p>
      A private chrome extension that integrates with the SoundCloud API to check
      whether broadcasts are properly uploaded to SoundCloud.
      Before this chrome extension, someone logs into SoundCloud
      and manually checks 30+ broadcasts one by one to make sure it has the correct
      permalink and title. The chrome extension turned a tedious, error-prone task into
      something that can be done accurately in a few seconds.
